    - [x] Hold alt+shift and drag range on waterfall for a new demodulator
    - [x] Hover demodulator on waterfall and press 'space' to toggle stereo
    - [x] Hover demodulator on waterfall and press 'd' or 'delete' to delete it
    - [x] Keyboard arrows adjust frequency, shift for faster change
    - [ ] Undo / Redo action
  - I/Q Recording and playback
    - [ ] Recording
      - [ ] Record I/Q input data
      - [ ] Simultaneously record demod decimated I/Q and audio
    - [ ] Playback
  - Audio
    - [ ] Recording
  - Optimization
    - [x] Eliminate large waterfall texture uploads
    - [ ] Update visuals to OpenGL 3.x
    - [ ] Resolve constant refresh on visuals that don't change often
    - [ ] Resolve driver/platform vertical sync issues
    - [ ] Group and divide IQ data distribution workload instead of 100% distribution per instance

Advanced Goals:
--------------
  - Support shell-based stdin/stdout tools for direct output/playback to/from CLI audio processing apps (i.e. DSD on OSX)
  - Update visuals to support OpenGL ES
  - Basic demodulator filter(s) that can be enabled and tweaked visually
  - Support multiple simultaneous device usage
    * Categorize devices by antenna connections
    * Allow locked frequencies to activate unused devices to continue demodulation on same antenna
  - Implement digital demodulation supported by liquid-dsp: (http://liquidsdr.org/doc/modem.html)
    * PSK, DPSK, ASK, QAM, APSK, BPSK, QPSK, OOK, SQAM, Star Modem(?)
  - Integrate LUA
    * Expose liquid-dsp functionality
    * Scriptable liquid-dsp demodulation
    * Scriptable digital demodulation output handlers
      - Create block output devices on *nix?
      - Create socket outputs?
      - Visual outputs?
    * Take control of additional devices and spawning new demodulators (i.e. trunkers)
    * Script manager / live editor
    * Provide scriptable liquid-dsp modulation for trancievers?
  - "PVR" like mode with waterfall time shifting
  - L/R and surround-sound balance settings for separating and listening to mono streams
  - Add tool for converting decimated I/Q recording to video
    - Select video features such as title/demodulation/scope/waterfall/etc
    - Render to video from GL frames->ffmpeg/mencoder /w demodulated audio

Target Platforms:
----------------
  - [x] OSX
  - [x] Windows
  - [x] Linux
