Advanced Goals and ideas:
------------------------
  - Design a plan for expansion via modules (dylib/dll/lua)
  - Support shell-based stdin/stdout tools for direct output/playback to/from CLI audio processing apps (i.e. DSD on OSX)
  - Update visuals to support OpenGL ES
  - Basic demodulator filter(s) that can be enabled and tweaked visually
  - Support multiple simultaneous device usage
    * Categorize devices by antenna connections
    * Allow locked frequencies to activate unused devices to continue demodulation on same antenna
  - Integrate LUA
    * Expose liquid-dsp functionality
    * Scriptable liquid-dsp demodulation
    * Scriptable digital demodulation output handlers
      - Create block output devices on *nix?
      - Create socket outputs?
      - Visual outputs?
    * Take control of additional devices and spawning new demodulators (i.e. trunkers)
    * Script manager / live editor
    * Provide scriptable liquid-dsp modulation for transceivers?
    * Allow scripts to launch/run headless (no UI)
  - "PVR" like mode with waterfall time shifting
  - L/R and surround-sound balance settings for separating and listening to mono streams
  - Add tool for converting decimated I/Q recording to video
    - Select video features such as title/demodulation/scope/waterfall/etc.
    - Render to video from GL frames->ffmpeg/mencoder /w demodulated audio
  - Accessibility / Control
    - USB/MIDI control surfaces
    - Joystick / gamepad input
    - Vibration / force-feeback
  - Investigate compilation via emscripten using SoapyRemote for input
    - Create web server+SoapyRemote bundle for embedded devices
    - Use emscripten compiled CubicSDR via embedded web server 

Target Platforms:
